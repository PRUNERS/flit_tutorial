<h2> Fortran Example Codes  </h2>

<blockquote>

<a href="ex5f.f.html"><h2>Example 5 (Fortran version)</h2></a>
<p>
This example solves the 2-D
Laplacian problem with zero boundary conditions
on an nxn grid.  The number of unknowns is N=n^2.
The standard 5-point stencil is used, and we solve
for the interior nodes only.
<p>
This example solves the same problem as Example 3.
Available solvers are AMG, PCG, and PCG with AMG or
Parasails preconditioners.
<a href="ex12f.f.html"><h2>Example 12 (Fortran version)</h2></a>
<p>
The grid layout is the same as ex1, but with nodal unknowns. The solver is PCG
preconditioned with either PFMG or BoomerAMG, set in the code.
<p>
We recommend viewing the Struct examples before viewing this and the other
SStruct examples.  This is one of the simplest SStruct examples, used primarily
to demonstrate how to set up non-cell-centered problems, and to demonstrate how
easy it is to switch between structured solvers (PFMG) and solvers designed for
more general settings (AMG).
